Install
=======
| Please use python 3.6 and let's avoid unnecessary issues.
| Current stable version is 1.5.0. please install that and avoid the master branch (requires some maintenance. will be updated once done) 
| Linux and Windows Installations are automatically tested. Mac OS users might have an issue with Bcolz.
  For now, refer to the original zipline docs if you do. Fixing this issue is in the backlog.
| If you use Python for anything other than Zipline, I **strongly** recommend
  that you install in a `virtualenv
<https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest>`_.

The `Hitchhiker's Guide to Python`_ provides an `excellent tutorial on virtualenv
<https://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_.


For now I support only installation through github. You could do that in one of these ways:

Installing with git clone
--------------------------
 * git clone https://github.com/shlomikushchi/zipline-trader.git
 * <create/activate a virtual env> - optional but recommended
 * pip install -e .

The last step will install this project from source, giving you the ability to debug zipline-trader's code.

Installing using pip directly from github
----------------------------------------------
You can install it with ability to debug it like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e git://github.com/shlomikushchi/zipline-trader.git#egg=zipline-trader

To install a specific version, you could do this (installing version 1.5.0):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e git://github.com/shlomikushchi/zipline-trader.git@1.5.0#egg=zipline-trader

Installing from pypi (coming soon)
-----------------------------------
The most known way of installing would be installing from pypi:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install zipline-trader

* Installing using Anaconda (Probably supported in the future)


Notes
----------

Installing zipline is a bit complicated, and therefore installing zipline-trader.
There are two reasons for zipline installation additional complexity:

1. Zipline ships several C extensions that require access to the CPython C API.
   In order to build the C extensions, ``pip`` needs access to the CPython
   header files for your Python installation.

2. Zipline depends on `numpy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_, the core library for
   numerical array computing in Python.  Numpy depends on having the `LAPACK
   <https://www.netlib.org/lapack>`_ linear algebra routines available.

Because LAPACK and the CPython headers are non-Python dependencies, the correct
way to install them varies from platform to platform.
Once you've installed the necessary additional dependencies (see below for
your particular platform)

GNU/Linux
))))))))))))))))

On `Debian-derived`_ Linux distributions, you can acquire all the necessary
binary dependencies from ``apt`` by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev python-dev gfortran pkg-config libfreetype6-dev hdf5-tools

On recent `RHEL-derived`_ derived Linux distributions (e.g. Fedora), the
following should be sufficient to acquire the necessary additional
dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo dnf install atlas-devel gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran libgfortran python-devel redhat-rpm-config hdf5

On `Arch Linux`_, you can acquire the additional dependencies via ``pacman``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pacman -S lapack gcc gcc-fortran pkg-config hdf5

There are also AUR packages available for installing `ta-lib
<https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ta-lib/>`_, an optional Zipline dependency.

OSX
))))))))))

The version of Python shipped with OSX by default is generally out of date, and
has a number of quirks because it's used directly by the operating system.  For
these reasons, many developers choose to install and use a separate Python
installation. The `Hitchhiker's Guide to Python`_ provides an excellent guide
to `Installing Python on OSX <https://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`_, which
explains how to install Python with the `Homebrew`_ manager.

Assuming you've installed Python with Homebrew, you'll also likely need the
following brew packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ brew install freetype pkg-config gcc openssl hdf5
